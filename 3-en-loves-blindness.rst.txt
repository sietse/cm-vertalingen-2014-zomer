Love’s Blindness 
================

| music: Ralf Pisters
| words: Alfred Austin


Originele tekst
---------------

| Now do I know that Love is blind, for I 
| Can see no beauty on this beauteous earth, 
| No life, no light, no hopefulness, no mirth, 
| Pleasure nor purpose, when thou art not nigh. 
|
| Thy absence exiles sunshine from the sky, 
| Seres Spring's maturity, checks Summer's birth, 
| Leaves linnet's pipe as sad as plover's cry, 
| And makes me in abundance find but dearth. 
|
| But when thy feet flutter the dark, and thou 
| With orient eyes dawnest on my distress, 
| Suddenly sings a bird on every bough, 
| The heavens expand, the earth grows less and less, 
| The ground is buoyant as the ether now, 
| And all looks lovely in thy loveliness.

| The ground is buoyant as the ether now,
| And all looks lovely in thy loveliness!
