1. Come, drink a jug of this!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Come, drink a jug of this!

| 1. O sailors all, as you pass by,
| call in and drink if you are dry.
| Come spend your money lads, don’t miss
| the chance to drink a jug of this,
| come drink!
| But I am old, with eyes so red,
| I’m grey of beard and bald of head,
| but still I rise to tender kiss
| from a pretty girl and a jug of this,
| come drink!

| 2. O sailors, if you’ve half a crown,
| you’re all so welcome to sit right down,
| and share with us that loving kiss
| and drink your fill of a jug of this, come drink! 
| So when I’m in my grave and dead,
| and all my sorrows past have fled,
| allow me then celestial bliss,
| an everlasting jug of this,
| come drink!

| Come, drink a jug of this!


2. Demons
~~~~~~~~~

| Woe is me,
| he came home from the sea
| and where he stood so handsome, now the devil in him be,
| where last I saw a man so proud to seek a life of fame,
| my heart would sing his praises then, but now I cry for shame,
| woe, woe is me,
| he came home from the sea
| and the devil in him be!

| Woe is me,
| I came home from the sea
| and where I left an angel now the devil in her be.
| Where last I saw a pretty maid with countenance so fair,
| there now abides a sullied wench no more of silken hair,
| woe, woe is me,
| I came home from the sea
| and the devil in her be. 

| Woe to us all,
| the devil’s been our fall,
| where was ambition, hope and strength, now drowned are they all,
| where youthful spirits thrived before dark demons dwell within,
| and all that was so fine and fair is washed away in sin.
| Woe, woe is me,
| divided by the sea,
| now the devil in us be. 


3. What shall we do with the drunken sailor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| What shall we do?
| What shall we do with the drunken sailor,
| what shall we do with the drunken sailor early in the morning?
| Hooray and up she rises, early in the morning! 

| What shall we do?
| Put him in a longboat ’till he’s sober, early in the morning.
| Hooray and up she rises,early in the morning! 

| What shall we do?
| Put him in the scuppers with a hosepipe on him, early in the morning!
| Hooray and up she rises, early in the morning! 

| What shall we do?
| Pull out the plug and wet him all over, early in the morning!
| Hooray, and up she rises, early in the morning! 

| What shall we do?
| Make him walk the plank and then keelhaul him, early in the morning!
| Hooray, and up she rises, early in the morning!

| What shall we do?
| Shave his belly with a rusty razor
| – No, no, no —
| Put him to bed with the captain’s daughter
| – How disgusting! —
| shave his belly with a rusty razor,
| bed with the captain’s daughter,
| early in the morning!
| Hooray and up she rises, early in the morning!
| Hooray and up she rises, early in the morning!
