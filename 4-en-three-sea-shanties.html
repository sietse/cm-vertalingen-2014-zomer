<p>Come, drink a jug of this!</p>
<p>1. O sailors all, as you pass by,<br />call in and drink if you are dry.<br />Come spend your money lads, don’t miss<br />the chance to drink a jug of this,<br />come drink!<br />But I am old, with eyes so red,<br />I’m grey of beard and bald of head,<br />but still I rise to tender kiss<br />from a pretty girl and a jug of this,<br />come drink!</p>
<p>2. O sailors, if you’ve half a crown,<br />you’re all so welcome to sit right down,<br />and share with us that loving kiss<br />and drink your fill of a jug of this, come drink!<br />So when I’m in my grave and dead,<br />and all my sorrows past have fled,<br />allow me then celestial bliss,<br />an everlasting jug of this,<br />come drink!</p>
<p>Come, drink a jug of this!</p>

<p>Woe is me,<br />he came home from the sea<br />and where he stood so handsome, now the devil in him be,<br />where last I saw a man so proud to seek a life of fame,<br />my heart would sing his praises then, but now I cry for shame,<br />woe, woe is me,<br />he came home from the sea<br />and the devil in him be!</p>
<p>Woe is me,<br />I came home from the sea<br />and where I left an angel now the devil in her be.<br />Where last I saw a pretty maid with countenance so fair,<br />there now abides a sullied wench no more of silken hair,<br />woe, woe is me,<br />I came home from the sea<br />and the devil in her be.</p>
<p>Woe to us all,<br />the devil’s been our fall,<br />where was ambition, hope and strength, now drowned are they all,<br />where youthful spirits thrived before dark demons dwell within,<br />and all that was so fine and fair is washed away in sin.<br />Woe, woe is me,<br />divided by the sea,<br />now the devil in us be.</p>
