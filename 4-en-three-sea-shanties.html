<li>Come, drink a jug of this! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>

<p>Come, drink a jug of this!</p>

<li><p>O sailors all, as you pass by, call in and drink if you are dry. Come spend your money lads, don’t miss the chance to drink a jug of this, come drink! But I am old, with eyes so red, I’m grey of beard and bald of head, but still I rise to tender kiss from a pretty girl and a jug of this, come drink!</p></li>
<li><p>O sailors, if you’ve half a crown, you’re all so welcome to sit right down, and share with us that loving kiss and drink your fill of a jug of this, come drink! So when I’m in my grave and dead, and all my sorrows past have fled, allow me then celestial bliss, an everlasting jug of this, come drink!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Come, drink a jug of this!</p>

<p>Woe is me, he came home from the sea and where he stood so handsome, now the devil in him be, where last I saw a man so proud to seek a life of fame, my heart would sing his praises then, but now I cry for shame, woe, woe is me, he came home from the sea and the devil in him be!</p>
<p>Woe is me, I came home from the sea and where I left an angel now the devil in her be. Where last I saw a pretty maid with countenance so fair, there now abides a sullied wench no more of silken hair, woe, woe is me, I came home from the sea and the devil in her be.</p>
<p>Woe to us all, the devil’s been our fall, where was ambition, hope and strength, now drowned are they all, where youthful spirits thrived before dark demons dwell within, and all that was so fine and fair is washed away in sin. Woe, woe is me, divided by the sea, now the devil in us be.</p>

<p>What shall we do? Put him in a longboat ’till he’s sober, early in the morning. Hooray and up she rises,early in the morning!</p>
<p>What shall we do? Put him in the scuppers with a hosepipe on him, early in the morning! Hooray and up she rises, early in the morning!</p>
<p>What shall we do? Pull out the plug and wet him all over, early in the morning! Hooray, and up she rises, early in the morning!</p>
<p>What shall we do? Make him walk the plank and then keelhaul him, early in the morning! Hooray, and up she rises, early in the morning!</p>
<p>What shall we do? Shave his belly with a rusty razor – No, no, no — Put him to bed with the captain’s daughter – How disgusting! — shave his belly with a rusty razor, bed with the captain’s daughter, early in the morning! Hooray and up she rises, early in the morning! Hooray and up she rises, early in the morning!</p>
