<h1 id="hymn-to-st.-cecilia">Hymn to St. Cecilia</h1>
<p>music: Benjamin Britten<br />words: W.H. Auden</p>
<h2 id="i.">I.</h2>
<p>In a garden shady this holy lady <br />With reverent cadence and subtle psalm, <br />Like a black swan as death came on <br />Poured forth her song in perfect calm: <br />And by ocean's margin this innocent virgin <br />Constructed an organ to enlarge her prayer, <br />And notes tremendous from her great engine <br />Thundered out on the Roman air. </p>
<p>Blonde Aphrodite rose up excited, <br />Moved to delight by the melody, <br />White as an orchid she rode quite naked <br />In an oyster shell on top of the sea; <br />At sounds so entrancing the angels dancing <br />Came out of their trance into time again, <br />And around the wicked in Hell's abysses <br />The huge flame flickered and eased their pain. </p>
<p>Blessed Cecilia, appear in visions <br />To all musicians, appear and inspire: <br />Translated Daughter, come down and startle <br />Composing mortals with immortal fire.</p>
<h2 id="ii.">II.</h2>
<p>I cannot grow; <br />I have no shadow <br />To run away from,<br />I only play. </p>
<p>I cannot err; <br />There is no creature <br />Whom I belong to, <br />Whom I could wrong. </p>
<p>I am defeat <br />When it knows it <br />Can now do nothing <br />By suffering. </p>
<p>All you lived through, <br />Dancing because you <br />No longer need it <br />For any deed. </p>
<p>I shall never be<br />Different. Love me. </p>
<p>Blessed Cecilia, appear in visions <br />To all musicians, appear and inspire: <br />Translated Daughter, come down and startle <br />Composing mortals with immortal fire.</p>
<h2 id="iii.">III.</h2>
<p>O ear whose creatures cannot wish to fall, <br />O calm of spaces unafraid of weight, <br />Where Sorrow is herself, forgetting all <br />The gaucheness of her adolescent state, <br />Where Hope within the altogether strange <br />From every outworn image is released, <br />And Dread born whole and normal like a beast <br />Into a world of truths that never change: <br />Restore our fallen day; O re-arrange. </p>
<p>O dear white children casual as birds, <br />Playing among the ruined languages, <br />So small beside their large confusing words, <br />So gay against the greater silences <br />Of dreadful things you did: O hang the head, <br />Impetuous child with the tremendous brain, <br />O weep, child, weep, O weep away the stain, <br />Lost innocence who wished your lover dead, <br />Weep for the lives your wishes never led. </p>
<p>O cry created as the bow of sin<br />Is drawn across our trembling violin. <br />O weep, child, weep, O weep away the stain. <br />O law drummed out by hearts against the still <br />Long winter of our intellectual will. <br />That what has been may never be again. <br />O flute that throbs with the thanksgiving breath <br />Of convalescents on the shores of death. <br />O bless the freedom that you never chose.<br />O trumpets that unguarded children blow <br />About the fortress of their inner foe. <br />O wear your tribulation like a rose. </p>
<p>Blessed Cecilia, appear in visions <br />To all musicians, appear and inspire: <br />Translated Daughter, come down and startle <br />Composing mortals with immortal fire.</p>
