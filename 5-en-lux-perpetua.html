<h1 id="lux-perpetua-peace-and-unity">Lux Perpetua – peace and unity</h1>
<p>music: Jonathan Willcocks</p>
<p>words: various authors</p>
<h2 id="section">1.</h2>
<p>Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine, et lux perpetua luceat eis.<br />The day will come, when I will make for you a covenant with the beasts of the fields, the birds of the air and the insects of the ground.<br />And I will remove the bow, the sword, and war from the earth.<br />And I will give you a life of peace.<br />Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, kyrie eleison</p>
<h2 id="section-1">2.</h2>
<p>An army marches, marches into war.<br />From the darkness a conflict beckons.<br />Officers drive men forward, the ranks respond,<br />with resolute stride, and innocent pride, the battle is joined.<br />As wave on wave of raw humanity, fresh to the blade, knowing little of the menace of the whetstone. Life’s flickering spark snuffed dark, so deadly a hand reaping the human harvest drawn to the sickle.<br />An army marches, marches into war. They hurl themselves to the perils that others have made.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, in your mercy, must it be so?<br />Sweet heaven, show us the way we may go.</p>
<p>Solo:<br />Be silent, and I will speak, be silent, listen to me, and I will teach you wisdom.</p>
<p>Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, Kyrie eleison.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">3.</h2>
<p>Light looked down and beheld Darkness<br />Thither will I go, said Light<br />Peace looked down and beheld War,<br />Thither will I go, said Peace.<br />Love looked down and beheld Hatred,<br />Thither will I go, said Love.<br />So came Light and shone,<br />So came Peace and gave rest,<br />So came Love and brought Life,<br />And the Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us.</p>
<p>Solo (alt + bas):<br />Let us be united, let us speak in harmony, common be our prayer, perfect be our unity.</p>
<p>Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, kyrie eleison</p>
<h2 id="section-3">4.</h2>
<p>At dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun<br />in the wild purple of the glow’ring sun,<br />Smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke<br />that shroud the menacing scarred slope.<br />And one by one tanks creep and topple forward to the wire.<br />The barrage roars and lifts.<br />Then, clumsily bowed with bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear,<br />men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire.<br />Lines of grey, muttering faces masked with fear,<br />they leave their trenches, going over the top,<br />while time ticks blank and busy on their wrists,<br />and hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists,<br />flounders in mud…<br />O Jesus, make it stop!</p>
<p>Solo (sopraan + tenor):<br />Show us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.</p>
<p>Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, Kyrie eleison</p>
<h2 id="section-4">5.</h2>
<p>Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;<br />where there is hatred, let me sow love,<br />where there is injury, pardon,<br />where there is discord, may there be union,<br />where there is doubt, faith.<br />Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;<br />where there is despair, let there be hope,<br />where there is darkness, light,<br />where there is sadness, may there be joy!<br />Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace.</p>
<p>Solo (alt + bas):</p>
<p>May we all be in peace, and may that peace come unto each of us.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">6.</h2>
<p>Et lux perpetua luceat eis.</p>
<p>Gather us in, thou love that filleth all,<br />gather our rival faiths within thy fold.<br />Rend each man’s templeveil and bid it fall,<br />that we may know that thou hast been of old.<br />Gather us in!</p>
<p>Soli (gezamenlijk):<br />As we are together, praying for peace,<br />we worship only thee,<br />in varied names we stretch a common hand.<br />Let us be truly with each other, praying for peace.<br />In diverse forms a common soul we see,<br />in many ships we seek one spirit land.<br />Gather us in!</p>
<p>Each sees one colour of thy rainbow light,<br />each looks upon one tint and calls it heaven.<br />Thou art the fullness of our partial sight,<br />we are not perfect till we find the seven.<br />Gather us in!</p>
<p>Requiescant in pace. Amen.</p>
