| Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine, et lux perpetua luceat eis.
| The day will come, when I will make for you a covenant with the beasts
  of the fields, the birds of the air and the insects of the ground.
| And I will remove the bow, the sword, and war from the earth.
| And I will give you a life of peace.
| Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, kyrie eleison

| An army marches, marches into war.
| From the darkness a conflict beckons, menacing every soul.
| Officers drive men forward, the ranks respond,
| with resolute stride, and innocent pride, the battle is joined.
| As wave on wave of raw humanity, fresh to the blade, knowing little of
  the menace of the whetstone. Life’s flickering spark snuffed dark, so
  deadly a hand reaping the human harvest drawn to the sickle.
| An army marches, marches into war. They hurl themselves to the perils
  that others have made.

| Dear Lord, in your mercy, must it be so?
| Sweet heaven, show us the way we may go.

| Solo:
| Be silent, and I will speak, be silent, listen to me, and I will teach
  you wisdom.

| Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, Kyrie eleison.

| Light looked down and beheld Darkness
| Thither will I go, said Light
| Peace looked down and beheld War,
| Thither will I go, said Peace.
| Love looked down and beheld Hatred,
| Thither will I go, said Love.
| So came Light and shone,
| So came Peace and gave rest,
| So came Love and brought Life,
| And the Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us.

| Solo (alt + bas):
| Let us be united, let us speak in harmony,
  common be our prayer, perfect be our unity.

| Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, kyrie eleison

| At dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun
| in the wild purple of the glow’ring sun,
| Smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke
| that shroud the menacing scarred slope.
| And one by one tanks creep and topple forward to the wire.
| The barrage roars and lifts.
| Then, clumsily bowed with bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear,
| men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire.
| Lines of grey, muttering faces masked with fear,
| they leave their trenches, going over the top,
| while time ticks blank and busy on their wrists,
| and hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists,
| flounders in mud…
| O Jesus, make it stop!

| Solo (sopraan + tenor):
| Show us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.

| Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, Kyrie eleison

| Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;
| where there  is hatred, let me sow love,
| where there is injury, pardon,
| where there is discord, may there be union,
| where there is doubt, faith.
| Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;
| where there is despair, let there be hope,
| where there is darkness, light,
| where there is sadness, may there be joy!
| Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace.

| Solo (alt + bas):

| May we all be in peace, and may that peace come unto each of us.

| Et lux perpetua luceat eis.

| Gather us in, thou love that filleth all,
| gather our rival faiths within thy fold.
| Rend each man’s templeveil and bid it fall,
| that we may know that thou hast been of old.
| Gather us in!

| Soli (gezamenlijk):
| As we are together, praying for peace,
| we worship only thee,
| in varied names we stretch a common hand.
| Let us be truly with each other, praying for peace.
| In diverse forms a common soul we see,
| in many ships we seek one spirit land.
| Gather us in!

| Each sees one colour of thy rainbow light,
| each looks upon one tint and calls it heaven.
| Thou art the fullness of our partial sight,
| we are not perfect till we find the seven.
| Gather us in!

| Requiescant in pace. Amen.
