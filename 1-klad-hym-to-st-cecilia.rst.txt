O ear whose creatures cannot wish to fall, 

O calm of spaces
* unafraid of weight, 
* Where Sorrow is herself, forgetting all 
  The gaucheness of her adolescent state, 
* Where Hope within the altogether strange 
  From every outworn image is released, 
* And Dread born whole and normal like a beast 
  Into a world of truths that never change: 
Restore our fallen day; O re-arrange. 

O dear white children casual as birds, 
  Playing among the ruined languages, 
  So small beside their large confusing words, 
  So gay against the greater silences 
  Of dreadful things you did: O hang the head, 
Impetuous child with the tremendous brain, 
O weep, child, weep, O weep away the stain, 
Lost innocence who wished your lover dead, 
Weep for the lives your wishes never led. 

O cry created as the bow of sin
Is drawn across our trembling violin. 

O weep, child, weep, O weep away the stain. 
O law drummed out by hearts against the still 
Long winter of our intellectual will. 
That what has been may never be again. 
O flute that throbs with the thanksgiving breath 
Of convalescents on the shores of death. 
O bless the freedom that you never chose.
O trumpets that unguarded children blow 
About the fortress of their inner foe. 
O wear your tribulation like a rose.
