<p>O ear whose creatures cannot wish to fall, </p>
<p>O calm of spaces * unafraid of weight,  * Where Sorrow is herself, forgetting all  The gaucheness of her adolescent state,  * Where Hope within the altogether strange  From every outworn image is released,  * And Dread born whole and normal like a beast  Into a world of truths that never change:  Restore our fallen day; O re-arrange. </p>
<p>O dear white children casual as birds,  Playing among the ruined languages,  So small beside their large confusing words,  So gay against the greater silences  Of dreadful things you did: O hang the head,  Impetuous child with the tremendous brain,  O weep, child, weep, O weep away the stain,  Lost innocence who wished your lover dead,  Weep for the lives your wishes never led. </p>
<p>O cry created as the bow of sin Is drawn across our trembling violin. </p>
<p>O weep, child, weep, O weep away the stain.  O law drummed out by hearts against the still  Long winter of our intellectual will.  That what has been may never be again.  O flute that throbs with the thanksgiving breath  Of convalescents on the shores of death.  O bless the freedom that you never chose. O trumpets that unguarded children blow  About the fortress of their inner foe.  O wear your tribulation like a rose. </p>
