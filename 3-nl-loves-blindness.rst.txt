Love’s Blindness 
================

music: Ralf Pisters
words: Alfred Austin

Now do I know that Love is blind, for I can see no beauty on earth. 
No life, no light, no hopefulness, no mirth.
Thy absence checks Summer’s Birth,
thy absence exiles the sunshine from the sky, 
Seres Spring’s maturity,
leaves linnet’s pipe sad as plover’s cry,
and makes me in abundance find but dearth. 

But when thy feet flutter the dark,
and when thou dawnest on my distress, 
Suddenly a bird sings on every bough,
the heavens expand,
the ground is buoyant as the ether now,
and all looks lovely in thy loveliness!
